Coursework for CSC221 Effective Programming

Let's play with some patterns.

A good directory to play with is /etc which is a directory containing config files for the system. As a normal user you may view the files but you can't make any changes so we can't do any harm. Do a listing of that directory to see what's there. Then pick various subsets of files and see if you can create a pattern to select only those files.
Do a listing of /etc with only files that contain an extension.
What about only a 3 letter extension?
How about files whose name contains an uppercase letter? (hint: [[:upper:]] may be useful here)
Can you list files whose name is 4 characters long?
