Coursework for CSC221 Effective Programming

Let's play with some content.

Start by creating a file and putting some content into it.
Save the file and view it in both cat and less
Go back into the file in vi and enter some more content.
Move around the content using at least 6 different movement commands.
Play about with several of the delete commands, especially the ones that incorporate a movement command. Remember you may undo your changes so you don't have to keep putting new content in.
