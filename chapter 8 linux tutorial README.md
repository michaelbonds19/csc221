Coursework for CSC221 Effective Programming

Let's play with some permissions.

First off, take a look at the permissions of your home directory, then have a look at the permissions of various files in there.
Now let's go into your linuxtutorialwork directory and change the permissions of some of the files in there. Make sure you use both the shorthand and longhand form for setting permissions and that you also use a variety of absolute and relative paths. Try removing the read permission from a file then reading it. Or removing the write permission and then opening it in vi.
Let's play with directories now. Create a directory and put some files into it. Now play about with removing various permissions from yourself on that directory and see what you can and can't do.
Finally, have an explore around the system and see what the general permissions are for files in other system directories such as /etc and /bin
