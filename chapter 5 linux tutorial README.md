Coursework for CSC221 Effective Programming

Start by creating a directory in your home directory in which to experiment.
In that directory, create a series of files and directories (and files and directories in those directories).
Now rename a few of those files and directories.
Delete one of the directories that has other files and directories in them.
Move back to your home directory and from there copy a file from one of your subdirectories into the initial directory you created.
Now move that file back into another directory.
Rename a few files
Next, move a file and rename it in the process.
Finally, have a look at the existing directories in your home directory. You probably have a Documents, Downloads, Music and Images directory etc. Think about what other directories may help you keep your account organised and start setting this up.
