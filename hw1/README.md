## Vim

#### Question 1
Vim's user-specific configuration file is located in the home directory: ~/. vimrc , and Vim files of current user are located inside ~/. vim/ . The global configuration file is located at /etc/vimrc . You may be lucky enough to have syntax highlighting already switched on in your version of Vim. If not, edit a vimrc file (either /etc/vimrc or, preferably,.vimrc in your home directory) 
#### Question 2
Vim isn’t limited to what you get “out of the box.” It’s possible to extend Vim pretty heavily, and many people have added features to Vim far and above plain old text editing.
A plugin is loaded automatically when Vim starts.
#### Question 3
Using Vundle.
